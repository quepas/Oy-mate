# Oy-mate

WEKA, HeaRT, OpenML and Auto-WEKA are mates!

## Consists of:
### Machine learning auto-configuration rules

Scripts for generating auto-configuration rules for machine learning algorithms using OpenML's knowledge, wisdom of WEKA and expressiveness of R.

Directory: **ml-auto-configuration-rules module**

### Auto-WEKA search space subset

Scripts for runing Auto-WEKA's hyperparameter optimization for given dataset on reduced subset of search space. It based on ranks derived from rules generetad by **ml-auto-configuration-rules** module.

Directory: **autoweka-search-space-subset**
